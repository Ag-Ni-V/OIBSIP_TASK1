# OIBSIP_TASK1
The following repository is made for showcasing my task done given by Oasis Infobyte during my internship.

A quick Java project called "Guess the Number" lets the user try to predict the number that the computer generates. It is entertaining and simple. entails the subsequent actions:

A random number is generated by the system from a range, say 1 to 100.

The user is asked to input their assigned number in a dialogue box that is presented.

The computer then determines if the entered number is higher or lower than the generated number, or if it matches the guesses number.

As long as the player guesses the number, the game continues.

You can include further information, such as:

limiting the quantity of tries.

adding additional rounds.

showing the score.

Giving points dependent on the amount of attempts.
